## 🐍 Classic Snake Game in Python

## 🎮 Overview
This is a **classic Snake game** built using **Python** and the **Turtle** graphics library.** The game features smooth movement, collision detection, and a **high score tracking system** that updates when a new high score is achieved. The game is designed to be fun, interactive, and a great way to practice Python game development.

## ✨ Features
- 🟢 **Smooth snake movement** using the Turtle library.
- 🍏 **Randomly spawning food** to increase the snake's length.
- 📈 **High score tracking** (stored in `highscore.txt`).
- 🎨 **Custom graphics** for background, snake head, and food.
- 🕹 **Arrow key controls** to navigate the snake.
- 🚀 **Event-driven programming** with real-time input handling.

## 🛠 Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snake-game-python.git
cd snake-game-python
```

### Install Dependencies
This game only requires Python's built-in Turtle and Random modules, so no additional installation is needed.

### Run the Game
```sh
python snake.py
```

## 🎮 How to Play
1. **Run the script** to start the game.
2. **Use arrow keys** (`↑ ↓ ← →`) to control the snake's movement.
3. **Eat the food** to grow the snake and increase your score.
4. **Avoid collisions** with the screen border or yourself.
5. The game will **track your highest score** and update it automatically.

## 📚 Learning Outcomes
This project helped me understand:
- The **Turtle library** for graphics & animations in Python.
- **Game loops & event-driven programming** for real-time interaction.
- **Collision detection** and **score tracking**.
- How to **store and retrieve data** for persistent high scores.

## 📌 Future Enhancements
- 🔊 Add sound effects.
- 🎨 Improve graphics and animations.
- 🏆 Implement different difficulty levels.
- 🌍 Allow online score submission for a global leaderboard.

## 🏆 Acknowledgments
This project was built with guidance from **LinkedIn Learning** courses and personal exploration of Python game development.
